# Onboarding Guide
## Building Your Cognitive Kernel

Welcome to AURELION Kernel (Lite Edition), your personal knowledge management framework.

## What Is This?

A structured system for organizing:
- Your career history
- Your skills and capabilities
- Your projects and work
- Your professional network
- Your strategic direction

## The 5-Floor Architecture

Think of this as a circular library with 5 floors:

### Floor 01: Foundation
**The ground floor - your operational base**

Start here. This is where you document:
- Who you are professionally (Career Master)
- What you can do (Skills Inventory)
- How you work day-to-day (Daily Operations)

### Floor 02: Systems
**The standards floor - how things work**

Your frameworks and definitions:
- Glossary of terms you use
- Communication standards
- Standard operating procedures

### Floor 03: Networks
**The relationship floor - who you know**

Your professional ecosystem:
- Network map (who and how)
- Your background story (your journey)
- Security and privacy guidelines

### Floor 04: Action
**The tactical floor - getting things done**

Templates and frameworks for execution:
- Project templates (reusable structures)
- Research templates (investigation frameworks)
- Decision trees (how you decide)

### Floor 05: Vision
**The strategic floor - where you're going**

Big-picture thinking:
- Personality framework (ADVISOR - how you work best)
- Strategic plan (your 1-5 year direction)
- Meta-knowledge (how you learn)

## Using GitHub Copilot

Each template file has suggested prompts. When you open a file, try:

1. **For Career Master:**
   - "Help me document my role as [YOUR TITLE] at [COMPANY]"
   - "Help me quantify the impact of [PROJECT]"

2. **For Skills:**
   - "What skills are essential for [YOUR PROFESSION]?"
   - "Organize my skills by proficiency level"

3. **For Strategic Plan:**
   - "Create a 3-year career plan for transitioning from [A] to [B]"

## Making It Yours

This is a starting point. Customize:

- **Add files:** Create new templates for your needs
- **Remove files:** Delete what doesn't apply
- **Reorganize:** Move things between floors if it makes sense
- **Rename:** Use terminology that fits your domain

## Maintaining Your Knowledge Base

### Weekly Review (15 minutes)
- Update recent changes in Hub Index
- Add new wins to Career Master
- Update Skills Inventory with new learning

### Monthly Review (30 minutes)
- Review strategic plan progress
- Update project statuses
- Reflect on personality framework insights

### Quarterly Deep Dive (2 hours)
- Full review of all floors
- Archive completed projects
- Adjust strategic goals
- Expand network map

## Advanced: Integration with aurelion-memory-lite

Once comfortable with the structure, install the Python engine:

```bash
pip install aurelion-memory-lite
```

This adds:
- Knowledge graph visualization
- Cross-reference detection
- Search capabilities
- Programmatic access

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to fill every file?**  
A: No! Start with what's relevant. Add more as needed.

**Q: Can I share this publicly?**  
A: It's designed for private use. Be careful with sensitive data.

**Q: Can I use this for a team?**  
A: Yes, but sanitize personal details. Focus on processes/templates.

**Q: How do I back this up?**  
A: It's just markdown files. Use Git, cloud sync, or both.
