## 💡 Philosophy: AAI Framework

**Autonomous Agentic AI (AAI)** is our approach to personal knowledge management:

- **Autonomous:** Self-organizing systems that maintain structure automatically
- **Agentic:** AI systems that can act on your behalf with your knowledge
- **AI Framework:** Architecture designed for intelligent agents and LLM integration

AAI emphasizes spatial organization (5-floor library), graph-based relationships, and agent-ready structure.

## 🗺️ AURELION Ecosystem

**AURELION** is a suite of modular AI systems designed to work together:

- **AURELION Memory-Lite** (this repo): Memory management system (the engine)
- **[AURELION Kernel-Lite](https://github.com/chase-key/aurelion-kernel-lite)**: Cognitive Kernel (the content structure)
- **AURELION-N**: Neural Nexus for autonomous agents (coming soon)

**AURELION Memory-Lite + AURELION Kernel-Lite work together:**
- AURELION Kernel-Lite provides the template structure (5 floors, career docs, skills inventory)
- AURELION Memory-Lite provides the Python engine (knowledge graph, cross-referencing, API)
- Together they form a complete personal knowledge system

**Recommended Usage:**
1. Clone [AURELION Kernel-Lite](https://github.com/chase-key/aurelion-kernel-lite) for your content structure
2. Install AURELION Memory-Lite to power the knowledge graph and API
3. Use both together for a complete system
=======
This kernel is part of the larger AURELION Ecosystem. See the [AURELION Hub](https://github.com/chase-key/aurelion-hub) for complete setup instructions and module integration guides.

## 💡 Philosophy: AAI Framework

**Autonomous Agentic AI (AAI)** guides the AURELION Kernel design:

- **Autonomous:** Self-organizing knowledge structure
- **Agentic:** Ready for AI agents to act on your behalf
- **AI Framework:** Optimized for LLM integration and intelligent automation

**Design Principles:**
- **5-Floor Architecture:** Organize knowledge spatially (like a building)
- **Graph-Based Relationships:** Files naturally link to each other
- **AI-Ready Structure:** Templates optimized for GitHub Copilot and future AI agents
- **Adaptive System:** Grows with your career and knowledge

The framework is inspired by circular library architecture (Rell's model from our world-building work).

## 🗺️ AURELION Ecosystem Overview

**AURELION** is a complete cognitive architecture for personal and organizational knowledge management:

**Module Architecture:**
- **KERNEL** - Knowledge structure and schema (this module)
- **MEMORY** - Persistent storage and retrieval
- **NEXUS** - Agent orchestration and workflow management
- **SIM** - Simulation and testing framework

**Product Tiers:**
- **Personal (Free)** - Individual use, file-based, ~50 API calls/month
- **Premium (Paid)** - Power users, vector DB, semantic search, unlimited
- **Business (Team)** - Multi-user, collaborative, organizational memory

**How they work together:**
1. **Kernel** provides the schema (how knowledge is organized)
2. **Memory** provides storage (where knowledge is kept)
3. **Nexus** coordinates agents (how knowledge is used)
4. **Sim** tests behavior (how agents learn)

**Getting Started:**
- For individuals: Start with KERNEL-Lite + MEMORY-Lite
- For teams: Start with kernel-business + memory-business
- For developers: See the [development guide](../../../docs/guides/development-setup.md)
