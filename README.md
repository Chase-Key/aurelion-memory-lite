## 🚀 Quick Start

This kernel is part of the larger AURELION Ecosystem. See the [AURELION Hub](https://github.com/chase-key/aurelion-hub) for complete setup instructions and module integration guides.

**To use this kernel:**
1. Navigate to this directory
2. Open in VS Code: `code .`
3. Start with `Floor_01_Foundation/01_Career_Master.md`

Open `Floor_01_Foundation/01_Career_Master.md` and start typing!  
**GitHub Copilot will help you fill it out.**

## 🔗 AURELION Ecosystem

This Kernel module is part of the larger AURELION Ecosystem:

- **[aurelion-kernel-lite](../aurelion-kernel-lite/)** (this module) - Single-person cognitive kernel
- **[aurelion-kernel-business](../aurelion-kernel-business/)** (planned) - Multi-entity kernel for organizations
- **[aurelion-memory](../../memory/)** - Storage and retrieval system  
  - Lite Edition (file-based)
  - Premium Edition (vector DB, semantic search)
  - Business Edition (multi-user, collaborative)
- **[aurelion-nexus](../../nexus/)** (planned) - Agent orchestration and routing
- **[aurelion-sim](../../sim/)** (planned) - Testing and simulation environment

**See the [AURELION Hub](https://github.com/chase-key/aurelion-hub) for complete ecosystem overview and integration guides.**

## 📚 Documentation

- [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) - Get started in 5 minutes
- [ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md](ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md) - Complete walkthrough
- [Floor Guide](docs/FLOOR_GUIDE.md) - What goes where
- [Copilot Prompts](docs/COPILOT_PROMPTS.md) - AI assistance tips

## 🎯 Who This Is For

- **Professionals** building personal knowledge bases
- **Job seekers** organizing career history
- **Consultants** managing client knowledge
- **Anyone** wanting structured personal documentation

## 💡 Philosophy

Based on the **5-floor library architecture** (Rell's model):
- Organize knowledge spatially (like a building)
- Navigate intuitively (like walking between floors)
- Cross-reference naturally (like inter-library connections)

## 🤝 Contributing

Share your improvements! If you create additional useful templates, consider contributing to the ecosystem.

**Ways to contribute:**
- 📝 Create new template variations (academic, creative, technical)
- 💬 Document your usage patterns and workflows
- 🐛 Report issues or suggest improvements
- 🔗 Share with others building personal knowledge systems

## 💡 Philosophy: AAI Framework

**Autonomous Agentic AI (AAI)** guides the AURELION Kernel design:

- **Autonomous:** Self-organizing knowledge structure
- **Agentic:** Ready for AI agents to act on your behalf
- **AI Framework:** Optimized for LLM integration and intelligent automation

**Design Principles:**
- **5-Floor Architecture:** Organize knowledge spatially (like a building)
- **Graph-Based Relationships:** Files naturally link to each other
- **AI-Ready Structure:** Templates optimized for GitHub Copilot and future AI agents
- **Adaptive System:** Grows with your career and knowledge

The framework is inspired by circular library architecture (Rell's model from our world-building work).

## 🗺️ AURELION Ecosystem Overview

**AURELION** is a complete cognitive architecture for personal and organizational knowledge management:

**Module Architecture:**
- **KERNEL** - Knowledge structure and schema (this module)
- **MEMORY** - Persistent storage and retrieval
- **NEXUS** - Agent orchestration and workflow management
- **SIM** - Simulation and testing framework

**Product Tiers:**
- **Personal (Free)** - Individual use, file-based, ~50 API calls/month
- **Premium (Paid)** - Power users, vector DB, semantic search, unlimited
- **Business (Team)** - Multi-user, collaborative, organizational memory

**How they work together:**
1. **Kernel** provides the schema (how knowledge is organized)
2. **Memory** provides storage (where knowledge is kept)
3. **Nexus** coordinates agents (how knowledge is used)
4. **Sim** tests behavior (how agents learn)

**Getting Started:**
- For individuals: Start with KERNEL-Lite + MEMORY-Lite
- For teams: Start with kernel-business + memory-business
- For developers: See the [development guide](../../../docs/guides/development-setup.md)
